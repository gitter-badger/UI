# Welcome to lymUI
## A soon to be nice template or framework.
_lymUI_ is a learning project and will most likely not be very stable.
You should not use this in production (yet)
Things on the to-do list that require javascript may take a longer time because I do not know javascript.
New suggestions are always welcome!
